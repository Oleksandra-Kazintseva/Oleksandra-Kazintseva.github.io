        <p>The hardest part is getting started. Because thousands of questions arise in my head. But the main thing is: will it work out? Suddenly I screw up, what to do then. Stop asking yourself these questions. The next question is: what exactly suits me? And you start taking tests, reading forums, having a bunch of meaningless conversations with acquaintances. Stop. Just start at the base. And then it will be easier to decide. Which courses to choose, which are better, which are more effective. All courses will tell about the same information, just start looking at several and decide for yourself which presentation of information you like best. Personally, I chose khan.academy.</p>
